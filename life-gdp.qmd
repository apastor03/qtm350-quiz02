title: "Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita"
---

This page explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita over time for various countries. Below is a chunk of R code that creates a graph that visualizes this relationship.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
gapminder_data <- read.csv("/Users/dafreir/Downloads/gapminder.csv")
ggplot(gapminder_data, aes(x = gdp_per_capita, y = life_expectancy, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs GDP per Capita", 
       x = "GDP per Capita (log scale)", 
       y = "Life Expectancy")
```
